        <h3>Current projects</h3>
        <h4>Personal website</h4>
        <p>Over the summer folowing the completion of my second year at university, I began developing this website.
        <br/>
        It has been made from scratch, using HTML and CSS for some styling.
        I aim to continue updating this website as I continue to develop my skills as a software developer. <br/>
        I would like to be able to self-host this website one day.
        </p>

        <h4>Instrument maintenance tracker</h4>
        <p>In the nearly 10 years that I have been playing any instrument other than the piano (there are quite a few),
            I noticed that there are significant maintenance tasks that must be done to keep you instrument sounding its best.<br/>
            This especially applies to string players, as we may need to get bows rehaired every 6 months to a year, and replace strings when they become worn out <br/>
            I would like to create a program, or possibly a mobile app that would allow a user to:
           </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add an instrument and accessories (such as bows), and record information about it such as purchase date, data made</li>
                <li>Add and view a list of all spare equipment, such as strings, rosin, that can also be searched and sorted by brand or string</li>
                <li>Record when a manintenance task is done, and other relevant details about the task</li>
                <li>Schedule routine maintenance tasks, and set reminders for these</li>
                <li>Log any damage to the instrument, such as scratches, cracks or dents, with the option to upload images</li>
                <li>Perform analysis on the wear of the instrument, and use this to generate reports, such as which string brand is the most hardwearing, and predict when maintenance needs to be done again</li>
                <li>Record useful contacts, such as local luthiers and music shops</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Initially, I plan to develop the program for string instruments only, but it has the scope to be extended to all instrument families over time.
        

        <h3>Completed projects</h3>

        <h4>The Fish Feeder Firmware</h4>

<h4>Rhyming words</h4>


        

      <h4>Arduino robot</h4>
      <p>
        My first project at university was to program an Arduino Uno in with a robot shield to follow a dark line on a light background, and decode various signs to navigate left, right or stop. <br/>
        The signs were parallel lines different distances apart on the path. <br/>
        The robot used LDRs to detect light and dark on the surface it was placed on, and an infrared transmitter and reciever to detect obstacles. <br/>
        The robot also communicated using three different coloured LED lights, and also had a single button, whcih was programmed to allow calibration of the servos and sensors and to start the path following. <br/>
      </p>

      


<h4>Band manager</h4>
        <p>
           For my A-Level Computer Science coursework, I created a piece of software tailored for one of the brass bands I played for at the time, <a href="https://www.porthywaensilverband.co.uk/">Porthywaen Silver Band</a>. <br/>
           Designed to digitalised and simplify all aspects of managing a band into one application, I allowed the user to:
           <ul>
            <li>Login to the program, with different permissions depending on the user's role within the organisation</li>
            <li>View and manage members, which can be filtered by instrument or the group that they play for</li>
            <li>View, add and edit a member and their details, including instrument, playing level, role in the band and contact details</li>
            <li>Create lists of players, which can be used to record attendance at rehearsals and band events</li>
            <li>View a calendar of events, and allow players to confirm their availablity for each event</li>
           </ul>
      </p>
